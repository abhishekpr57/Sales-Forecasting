# Sales-Forecasting

The dataset I have used is of a furniture sales which has the data upto January 2018 and our task is to predict the further sales of the upcoming years.

Sales forecasting is the process of estimating future sales. Accurate sales forecasts enable companies to make informed business decisions and predict short-term and long-term performance.
